# Admission_in_usa_using_SVM

Hello,this project aim is to tell a person whether he/she can get an admission in USA for masters based on some feautures namely,
gre-gre_score
gpa-gpa_in_clg
SES-SES refers to socioeconomic status: 1 - low, 2 - medium, 3 - high.
Gendermale-(0, 1) = 0 -> Female, 1 -> Male
Race â€“ 1, 2, and 3 represent Hispanic, Asian, and African-American
Rank-The variable rank takes on the values 1 through 4. Institutions with a rank of 1 have the highest prestige, while those with a rank of 4 have the lowest.

classes:
admit- 1=yes and 0=no

By using these feautures we gonna predict whether he/she can get an admission in the US or not.

Here we are building the model by SVM classifier algorithi,

And in this project we can see my data science operations like,
1-> finding and managing the missing values
2-> identifying and eliminating the outliers
3-> balancing the data (if it is imbalanced)

we have like hyper paramerter tunning using GridSearchCV

........thnak you...........
